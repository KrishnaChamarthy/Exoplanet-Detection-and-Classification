# Exoplanet Detection and Classification Project

This project focuses on detecting and classifying exoplanets using machine learning techniques with data sourced from the Kepler Space Telescope. The primary goal is to differentiate between confirmed exoplanets and false positives based on their light curve data.

## Project Overview
- Processed over **100,000** light curve data points, handling missing values and normalizing datasets to ensure quality input for the model.
- Implemented and tested various supervised learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to accurately classify potential exoplanets.
- Achieved an overall accuracy of **99.5%**, optimizing models with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, leading to a **15%** reduction in false positive rates.
- Visualized results with interactive plots, highlighting the most significant features that contribute to accurate classification, improving model interpretability by **20%**.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized raw data for consistent machine learning inputs.
- **Model Implementation**: Utilized machine learning techniques for efficient detection and classification.
- **Optimization**: Applied cross-validation and tuning for high accuracy and reduced errors.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive visualizations to analyze feature importance and model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook for development, data analysis, and visualization

## Results
The project successfully classifies exoplanets with a high degree of accuracy, providing insights into which features are most indicative of potential exoplanets. The workflow can be applied to other datasets for future exoplanet detection research.
